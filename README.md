# Histopathy Mitosis Classification
An implementation of mitosis classification from histopathy images using random forests.
Dowload pre-trained models at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xyoya5f9q9l4uhv/AACas0LX3WPyusVa-WSt5ORaa/save?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1 and move to ./save folder.
Images (in folder structure) go to ./data.
Tested with Python 3.8.
In order to just perform classification just run hist_image_classification.py
In order to re-train models perform pipeline: preprocess, train, predict.
